## Version 0.12 (Dec 24, 2010)

list] and uses a new [source code repository].

Many thanks to Andrea Rossato, xombar's author and maintainer so far,
for creating xmobar in the first place, and for giving me the chance
to become its maintainer. And a big thanks to Ben Boeckel, Petr Rockai
and Norbert Zeh for their patches.
